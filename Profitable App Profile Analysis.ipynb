    "# Profitable App Profiles for the Google Play and Apple App Store Markets\n",

    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to find mobile applications that are profitable for the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting:\n",
    "- We are working as Data Analyst for a fictional company that builds iOS and Android mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make **data-driven** decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining my code:\n",
    "- Aside from the objective of this project, this is also a learing project for me. Thus I will like to go into more detail explaining what a complex line of code actually does. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of what that would look like:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Fun fact:**\n",
    "    Each character we use in a string has a corresponding number associated with it. For instance, the corresponding number for character 'a' is 97 , character 'A' is 65, and character '爱' is 29,233. We can get the corresponding number of each character using the ord() built-in function [Link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord)\n",
    "    \n",
    "So if we were to take the approach of deleting any app that uses non-english characters, we need to find the range of  numbers corresponding to the characters we commonly use in English language. That's easy to find. Just a simple Wikipedia search! [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). English text seemt to be in the range of 0-127.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use this number range (0-127) and assume that an app name that contains a character greater than 127 is probably a non-english app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another road block would be the fact that our app names our stored as a string. So we need to find a way to check each individual character in a string and check it's corresponding characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, in Python, strings are indexable and iterable, which means we can use indexing to select an individual character, and we can also iterate on the string using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's write the function that to detect non-english apps!\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation inside the function:\n",
    "- Inside the function, iterate over the input string. For each iteration check whether the number associated with the character is greater than 127. When a character is greater than 127, the function should immediately return False — the app name is probably non-English since it contains a character that doesn't belong to the set of common English characters.\n",
